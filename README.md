# Top-Down Shooter

###  Project 

This is just an small game that i made, it has a lot of things to complete but i was just trying Unity.
There are two levels with deferent monsters, each monster has its own way of doing damage. When you kill all of them, bosses spawn and you need to kill them too
you win by killing everything.
